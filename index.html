<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently working as a Web Designer. I have a BFA in graphic design with a minor in computer science. I am here to get better at full stack development and start my web development career. I am a metalhead and go to many concerts. I am also a concert photographer. Check out my work <a href="instagram.com/libersword" target="_blank">here!</a> I play piano, love videogames, and have a one eyed cat named Captain. He is tubby, orange, and yells constantly. I love to play RPG's and run campaigns.</p>
